# MERN-application

This is a mern application, with CRUD operations available, it is designed to get information from a MongoDB database. 
It's purpose is to store memories which you can, (obviously) perform CRUD operations on.

Get the app running:
  -download the existing files.
  -navigate into the server using the terminal and run 'npm intall'
  -navigate into the client directory also using the terminal and run 'npm install'
  -After you have completed the above steps, navigate to the server using VScode and create a .env file
   using the example file titled '.env.example' you will need to add a MongoDB URL to a collection you have,
   and you will need to enter a port for the server to run on.
  -It should all work fine after that is done, if you have any questions or if you get an error please comment below I will fix it as soon as I can
